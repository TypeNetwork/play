# Play
by Jonas Hecksher, Playtypes, e-types AS

Play is a minimalistic sans serif typeface designed by Jonas Hecksher during his time as Type Director of Playtype Type Foundry. All letters in Play derive from the 'O' – square and circular at the same time. Play is designed with large, open counters, ample lowercase x-heights and a corporate, yet friendly appearance. The combination of these qualities give Play both a high legibility and readability.
